              The Parthenon is one of the most popular historical monument in Athens, Greece. Being the largest, and the most magnificent 
              temple in mainland Greece, it was a center for religious activity in the Greek city-state of Athens. It was built during the
              reign of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League" target = "_blank">Delian League</a>, dedicated to the Greek Goddess

               <h3> Etymology - Meaning Of The Word 'Parthenon':</h3>
                   <p> The Parthenon has had many different names over the course of history. </p>

			<p> 
			    Parthenon is a Greek word, meaning "unmarried women's apartments" in a house. However, it was used in the context
                            of referring to a single room in the house. In the case of the Parthenon, it is undecided on which room it was initially referring to. 
                            The first instance of it being recorded as the entire building is in the writings of the 4th century BC orator Demosthenes. It is also 
                            said to have initially referred to as <i> Hekatompedos </i> or the <dfn><i> Hekatompdon </i></dfn>("hundred-footer").
			    <br /> It was also sometimes referred to as the Temple of Minerva, which is the Roman name for Goddess Athena, especially during the 
                             19<sup>th</sup> century.

		<h3>Architecture</h3>
		    <p> 
			Renowed Greek architects Ictinus and Callicrates and the sculptor Phidias are said to have designed the Parthenon. It is said to be 
                        a <dfn> Doric </dfn>temple (<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doric_order" target = "_blank">Doric order</a> was one of the 
                        three orders of Ancient Greece and Rome - the other two are <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_order" target = "_blank">Ionic</a>
                        and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_order" target = "_blank">Corinthian</a>. These were styles of architecture).

			    The structure has a rectangular floor plan and is built on a 23,000-square foot base, part of which was the limestone foundation of the 
			    old Parthenon. According to one theory, the old Parthenon was destroyed when the Persians attacked Athens and destroyed the Acropolis.
			    There are 46 Doric outer columns and 19 inner columns. The structure also influences of Ionic architecture.
                            <br />
			    <b> The greatest feat of the architectural design of the Parthenon is that it has no right angles, and no straight lines.</b> It is truly an
			    unbelievable piece of architecture.

		<h3> What Is Its Significance? </h3>
		     <p>
			The Parthenon signified victore, wealth, and cultural superiority. Since the new structure was built after the victory over the Persians, 
			the monument is a symbol of Athens' democracy and independence. It signified strength and political superiority. 
			<br />
			The monument was also dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena, who the Athenians considered their patron. She also happens to be the symbol
			of freedom and democracy.

			Although it is no longer present, Parthenon was home to an extraordinary statue of the goddess, known as Athena Parthenos. It is speculated
			to have stood 39 feet tall. It was carved of wood and covered in ivory and gold.
